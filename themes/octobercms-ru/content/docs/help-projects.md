## Introduction

Projects are required if you want to use any [Marketplace plugins](/plugins). You can create a project on the [Projects page](/account/projects) in the Account area or from the **Add to Project** popup window on a Marketplace plugin page. When you have a project you can add plugins to it. The plugins you add to your projects are installed automatically when you update your October installation.

Projects are very useful if you have multiple copies of a same website, for example - several development installation, a staging copy and the production copy. All these installation can be bound to a same project. When you add a plugin to a project on the [October website](/) all your installations will download the plugin as soon as you update them. This reduces the maintenance overhead.
